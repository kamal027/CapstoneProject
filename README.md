Project Stages : 
	1. Import Dataset
    o	Import dataset
    o	Import relevant libraries for data handling and visualization. 
  
  2. Pre processing
    o	Standardize numerical variables using scale functions. 
    o	Impute missing values (if any) and Treat outliers.
    o	Remove variable dependencies. 

  3. Exploratory Data Analysis
    o	Analyze and visualize dataset variables using statistical techniques
    o	Find missing values.
    o	Find dependencies.
    
  4. Treat Class Imbalance 
    o	Apply Random under sampling and SMOTE oversampling to treat class imbalance.
    o	Re-train the models and compare results to original

  5. Data Modeling
    o	Split dataset into train-test sets. 
    o	Build Regression model using training set
    o	Build Random forest classifier model using the same training set.
    o	Use model to predict values for test set.

   6. Evaluation
    o	Use model to predict values for test set.
    o	Calculate confusion matrix and evaluate model performance based on Accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity and precision.
    
   7. Summary
     o	Compare results for the two models under original and modified dataset.
     o	Identify best performance based on evaluation metrices.
     o	Evaluate if Under/Oversampling techniques affect the performance of the model
